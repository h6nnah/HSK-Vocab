# HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) Word Lists

These word lists were generated from the PDFs that are available at the
[China Education Centre](http://chinaeducenter.com/en/exams.php) website. Other
HSK word lists I have come across have all been either PDFs, Excel
spreadsheets, or web pages. Many of them were not consistent with each other
and didn't even list the same number of words that are reported on the official
HSK websites that I visited. Each file lists all the words that make up the
required vocabulary for that level.

I hope these are useful, but since I created these using scripts and have not
checked them in any detail, there may be errors. These lists are for
informational purposes only.
